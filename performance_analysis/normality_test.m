function [pd, hk, pk] = normality_test (samples)
% normality_test: checks if samples come from a normal distribution.
%
% INPUT
%   samples: Nx1 samples to test.
%
% OUTPUT
%    pd: probality distribution object from ProbabilityDistribution class.
%    hk: = 0 => samples come from a normal distribution.
%        = 1 => samples do not come from a normal distribution.
%    pk: p-value.
