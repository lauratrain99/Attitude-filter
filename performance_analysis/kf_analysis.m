%% INNOVATION CONSISTENCY

% Innovations should be zero mean and uncorrelated.

N = max( size( nav_e.tg ) ) ;

chi = zeros(N,1);

for i=1:N
    
    S = reshape(nav_e.S(i,:), 6, 6);
    
    chi(i) = nav_e.v(i,:) * S * nav_e.v(i,:)';
end

% Chi must include positive and negative numbers in order to represent a
% Guassian distribution
chi_t = [chi; -chi];
