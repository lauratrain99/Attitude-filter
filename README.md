Data fusion of gyro and accelerometer for one IMU

For latest work: brach in_process

Case studies:

static test: go to synthetic-data/static_IMU/static_IMU.m
one axis rotation:
constant rotation around x-axis: synthetic-data/one_axis_angular_IMU/x_axis.m
constant rotation around y-axis: synthetic-data/one_axis_angular_IMU/y_axis.m
constant rotation around z-axis: synthetic-data/one_axis_angular_IMU/z_axis.m
To see how the data for gyro and accelerometer is obtained go to synthetic-data/IMU_simulator.m
