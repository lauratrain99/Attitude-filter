function deltha = gyro_gen_delta(DCMnb_m, t)
% gyro_gen_delta: calculates gyros delta angles.
%
% INPUT
%   DCMnb_m: Nx9 matrix with nav-to-body direct cosine matrices (DCM).
%       Each row of DCMnb_m contains the 9 elements of a particular DCMnb
%       matrix ordered as [a11 a21 a31 a12 a22 a32 a13 a23 a33].
%	t: Mx1 time vector (seconds).
%
% OUTPUT
%	deltha: Mx3 gyros delta angles [X, Y, Z] (rad, rad, rad).
