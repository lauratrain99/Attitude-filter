function cor_b = coriolis_b(lat, vel, h, DCMnb_m)
% coriolis_b: projects Coriolis forces from navigation frame to the body frame
%
% INPUT
%	lat: Nx1 latitudes (radians).
%	vel: Nx3 NED velocities [N E D] (m/s, m/s, m/s).
%   h:   Nx1 altitude (meters).
%   DCMnb_m: Nx9 matrix with nav-to-body direct cosine matrices (DCM).
%       Each row of DCMnb_m contains the 9 elements of a particular DCMnb
%       matrix ordered as [a11 a21 a31 a12 a22 a32 a13 a23 a33].
%
% OUTPUT
%	cor_b: Nx3 Coriolis forces in the body frame [X Y Z] (m/s^2, m/s^2, m/s^2).
