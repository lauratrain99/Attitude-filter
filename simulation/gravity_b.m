function g_b = gravity_b(lat, h, DCMnb_m)
%  gravity_b: computes gravity vector in the b-frame.
%
% INPUT
%	lat: Nx1 latitudes (radians).
%	h: Nx1 altitudes (meters)
%   DCMnb_m: Nx9 matrix with nav-to-body direct cosine matrices (DCM).
%       Each row of DCMnb_m contains the 9 elements of a particular DCMnb
%       matrix ordered as [a11 a21 a31 a12 a22 a32 a13 a23 a33].
%
% OUTPUT
%	g_b: Nx1 gravity force in the body frame.
