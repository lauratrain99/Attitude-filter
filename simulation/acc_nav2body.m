function fb = acc_nav2body (acc_n, DCMnb_m)
% acc_nav2body: transforms accelerations from navigation frame to body
% frame.
%
% INPUT
%	acc_n: Nx3 matrix with [fn, fe, fd] accelerations in the navigation
%		frame.
%   DCMnb_m: Nx9 matrix with nav-to-body direct cosine matrices (DCM).
%       Each row of DCMnb_m contains the 9 elements of a particular DCMnb
%       matrix ordered as [a11 a21 a31 a12 a22 a32 a13 a23 a33].
%
% OUTPUT
%	fb: Nx3 matrix with [fx, fy, fz] simulated accelerations in the
%		body frame.
