function [rrw_n] = noise_rrw (rrw, dt, M)
% noise_rrw: generates rate random walk noise.
%
% INPUT
%		rrw: 1x3 level of rate random walk.
%		dt: 1x1 sampling time.
%   M: 1x2 dimensionx of output vector.
%
% OUTPUT
%		rrw_n: M matrix with simulated rate random walk noise [X Y Z] 
%     (rad/s^2, rad/s^2, rad/s^2).
